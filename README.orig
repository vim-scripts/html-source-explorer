The "HTML Source Explorer" plugin is meant to aid on the html source exploring.
It allows you to follow links by opening them on a new buffer on vim (the same
way you can follow links on Mozilla Firefox/Chrome view source).

By using <leader>fl inside "", '' or (), if it is a link (absolute, or
relative) the file will be open. 

It works both on http:// urls and local files.

This plugin also includes a |:Wget| command which allows you to open a copy of
a remote file for editing in vim
